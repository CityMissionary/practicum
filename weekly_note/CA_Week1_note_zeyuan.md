## Note
 During this meeting, Mr Cai introduced the company's history and some achievements that they had already achieved. He also answerd our questions and let us know what the project exactly need to be done. Meanwhile I learnt that the data of GMRF would be in JSON type that needs me to spend some time to search how to deal with JSON profiles. What's more the backtest part should also be considered carefully. In the next week, we should spend out time reading the materials and learning from the previous projects. I hope that I can construct an aviliable working frame and have some init ideas to deal with our projects.

### Introduce
Southeast University
I have a bachalor degree of computer science and equipped with strong programming skill in Python, C++ and familiared with many classic machine learning models. I once worked as an intern at one of the largest quant companies in China. In that company I tested factors which were mentioned in some research papers, washed original stock data, instructed factors, backtested them and analyzed the outcome. And I also have a background in NLP area. Working with my teammate, we proposed the Time Relaxed Temporary Random Walk(TXT Walk Algorithm), which is a more useful embedding method in network representation.
