To move beyond the obstacles that\nhold us back provides a sense of relief and freedom, and\nit's something I want to address in this year's annual letter:\nhow freedom, data and Hexagon are inextricably linked.\nAs challenging as the last two years have been, there\nexists a completely different yet equally extraordinary\nphenomenon that continues to test our agility and speed.\nPundits heralded the IoT, the so-called Internet of Things,\nas the next new \"thing\" that would deliver trillions in value.\nThe connectivity of billions of devices and absurd amounts\nof data was intended to set us free, enabling us to achieve\nour greatest potential.\nInstead, the data deluge has us scrambling. We find ourselves\nin an overwhelmingly complex situation, determinedly\nendeavouring to use data to make businesses run better and\noperate more sustainably. Ironically, as our hunger for data\ngrows, so does our inability to harness it-impinging on our\nfreedom and slowing progress across industry.\nIt is for this very reason we chose to make a bold strategic shift\ntoward empowering an autonomous future a few years ago.\nThis strategy targets the rapidly widening gap between data\ncreation and usage, bringing the freedom of to sensor-software\nsolutions so that data is no longer an obstacle.\nWe've been connecting sensors to software for years-this\nwas nothing new. But what was, and still is, revolutionary is\ncreating value by empowering customers to leverage this\ndata in new, world-changing ways-providing the freedom\nto do their best work.\nThis is how Hexagon will drive sustainability, growth and\nshareholder value for years to come. The freedom that\nbrings to data is opening new ways to understand the world\nand make decisions-creating value for our customers\nwhere they need it most: (1) resilience, (2) innovation and\n(3) sustainability.","resilience needs freedom from uncertainty":"Uncertainty is something we're hardwired to dislike. Yet, it\nseems to be the only certain reality we face. With the right\ntools and supports in place, we can emerge stronger when\nthe unexpected hits.\nHexagon has long been a leader in delivering smart digital\nrealities that require real-time and autonomous data\ncapture, analyses and visualisation. Our solutions integrate\nreal-world sensor inputs with software systems built to\nanalyse, predict and act-in real-time and autonomously-\nto create new and better realities that address uncertainty\nand enable resilient organisations, teams and workflows.\nWe made six acquisitions in 2021 to further strengthen\nthese capabilities in the areas of manufacturing, industrial\nmaterials tracking, augmented reality applications and\nEAM (enterprise asset management).","innovation needs freedom to accelerate":"The ability to fully leverage data changes our thought\nprocesses and approach to innovation. It becomes an\nindispensable resource for fostering new value creation\nand knowledge.\nFor example, in June we launched the future of citywide\ncollaboration and connected data communities with HxGN\nConnect, an SaaS collaboration workspace purposely built\nto bridge communication gaps, break down data siloes, and\nimprove safety and scalability.\nHxGN Connect provides greater freedom for government\nagencies and other diverse organisations to coordinate\naction for ad hoc, routine and emergency situations. Users\ncan work with people and information irrespective of\norganisational and geographical affiliations or technology\nlimitations-bridging gaps between vertical sectors,\norganisation types and operational functions to drive\nsafer communities, more effective services and happier\nresidents. In October, we extended our iconic, award-winning BLK\nsensor series with fully autonomous mobile reality capture,\ngiving our customers greater freedom to capture the world\nwith precision and simplicity. We introduced the Leica BLK\nARC, an autonomous laser scanning module for robots, and\nthe Leica BLK2FLY, an autonomous flying laser scanner\nwith advanced obstacle avoidance.\nBoth purposefully integrated sensor-software systems\nbring autonomous agility and speed to any reality-capture\nworkflow. They dynamically adjust reality-capture missions\nfor seemingly limitless business applications-from\nas-built site documentation for buildings to monitoring\nand situational awareness of remote or hazardous\nenvironments, such as mines, factory floors, off-shore\nfacilities, fire investigations and more.\nLate in 2021, we launched HxGN MineMeasure to put data\nto work in the delivery of high-value ore. MineMeasure\ncombines blast design software, high-precision drilling,\nblast movement monitoring, fragmentation analysis and\nenterprise analytics to empower customers with a data-\ndriven feedback loop calibrated to increase profit from\nevery blast while minimising ore loss.\nImproving ore recovery by just 1 per cent can mean\nmillions of dollars for a mine. Not only does MineMeasure\naddress the small, compounding errors that lead to costly\nconsequences throughout the notoriously complex\ndrill and blast cycle, but it also addresses sustainability\nof precious resources-diminishing unintentional loss\n(sending ore to a waste dump) and dilution (sending waste\nto the mill).\nThese are just a few of the hundreds of innovations we\nlaunched in 2021.","sustainability needs freedom to grow and profit":"It wasn't long ago that growth, profitability and\nsustainability were seen as mutually exclusive objectives.\nToday, leaders must achieve all three, and it's our\nambition to unleash industry transformations that create\nunparalleled opportunities to help them succeed.\nWith solutions that leverage data to free industry to do\nwhat's right, we create the freedom to grow in a way that\nis both sustainable and profitable. For more than two\ndecades, we've contributed to environmental and social\nsustainability by improving efficiency, productivity, quality\nand safety-the antidotes to waste, pollution, diminishing\nmargins and increased risk. Through our solutions we\nenable factories, cities, industrial facilities, construction\nprojects and almost any other endeavour to become safer,\nmore productive, more efficient and more profitable.\nBut green-tech projects can benefit from many of the\nsame digital reality solutions, which is why we launched\nR-evolution in early 2021. Founded to accelerate the\ntransition to a sustainable economy, R-evolution runs\nprofit-driven investments in green-tech projects where\nHexagon's technology can be applied. Saving the planet is\nthe biggest business opportunity of the 21st century, and\nR-evolution is Hexagon's opportunity to motivate action\nthrough profitable change that gives back to the planet.\nOut of the gate, R-evolution leveraged multiple Hexagon\ntechnologies to construct and operate cutting-edge solar\nfarms. Later in the year, R-evolution began mapping the\nthreatened seagrass meadows of the Caribbean with our\nairborne bathymetric LiDAR technologies-detecting,\nmapping and capturing critical details about this vital blue\ncarbon ecosystem.\nWithout a doubt, companies that can help the world\nachieve its environmental goals must step up to lead. We're\nproud to be a sustainability enabler with plans to expand\nfocus to sustainable agriculture, cleaning up our oceans,\nprotecting our forests and more.\nWe're also deeply committed to driving sustainable\noutcomes through our actions, supported by the launch\nof a new sustainability programme in 2021. It outlines our\nkey environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals\ncentred on carbon emissions, supplier audits and diversity.\nIt articulates our ESG targets for 2023 and beyond that\ninclude significant reductions in our carbon footprint,\nbetter management of supply chain risks and improved\ngender balance across our leadership team.\nWe also joined the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA),\nthe world's largest industry coalition dedicated to\ncorporate social responsibility in global supply chains.\nOur membership is an important step towards reaching\nour ESG goals, enabling Hexagon to engage with some of\nthe world's leading companies to improve working and\nenvironmental conditions across the globe.","doing well to do good":"Tackling climate change is humanity's defining challenge\nin the twenty-first century. The systems that have fuelled\nour growth and wellbeing must be transformed. Bottom\nline, industry needs to do well to do good. This is our\nNorth Star, our guiding principle: that people and the\nplanet can sustainably thrive only when industry and\nbusiness prosper.\nDoing better requires constant, incremental change that\nleverages current technologies, improving and innovating\nto optimise efficiency, productivity, quality and safety. But\nbetter isn't enough.\nIt is our commitment to go beyond better, creating\nexponential change with disruptive and unconventional\nmethods that make giant leaps forward. We have the\nresources and ingenuity to drive continued business value\nthat ensures economic growth, and not at the expense of\nthe planet or people.\nI want to thank our shareholders for your continuing\nsupport, confidence and trust. It is without a doubt that\nour passion for an autonomous, sustainable future will\ncontinue to generate the profitable returns you have come\nto expect. We can and will continue freeing industry to put\ndata to work to grow sustainably, achieve sustainable gains\nin performance and build business models that will thrive\ninto the future.\nOur greatest work to accelerate groundbreaking\ninnovations that simultaneously scale profitability and\nsustainability lies ahead.\nOla RollÃ©n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n@OlaRollen"}},"strategy":{"hexagon is committed to empowering an autonomous future":{"data":"Hexagon's strategy is focused on the rapidly widening gap between the enormous amounts of\ndata being created, and the world's ability to harness it.

The pension premiums for premium defined\npension shall amount to not more than 20 per cent of the fixed\nannual cash salary. As a general guideline, pension benefits\nfor other executives, including health insurance, shall be fee\nbased. Deviations from this general guideline may be made\nwhen appointing new senior executives whose employment\nagreements already comprise benefit-based pension plans or\nif the executive is covered by benefit pensions in accordance\nwith mandatory collective agreement provisions.

The period of notice for senior\nexecutives is a maximum of 24 months. During the notice\nperiod, basic salary is the only severance pay.\nThe variable cash remuneration shall be linked to\nindividualised predetermined and measurable criteria.\nThe criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to the\ncompany's business strategy and long-term interests,\nincluding its sustainability, by for example being clearly\nlinked to the business strategy or promote the executive's\nlong-term development.

Internal control\npertaining to financial reporting is a process that involves\nthe Board, company management and other personnel.\nThe process has been designed so that it provides\nassurance of the reliability of the external reporting.\nAccording to a generally accepted framework that has\nbeen established for this purpose, internal control is\nusually described from five different perspectives:","1. control environment":"Hexagon's organisation is designed to facilitate rapid\ndecision making. Accordingly, operational decisions are\ntaken at the business area or subsidiary level, while decisions\nconcerning strategies, acquisitions and company-wide\nfinancial matters are taken by the company's Board and\nGroup Management. The organisation is characterised by\nwell-defined allocation of responsibility and well-functioning\nand well-established governance and control systems,\nwhich apply to all Hexagon units.

The\nBoard's monitoring of the company's assessment of its\ninternal control includes contacts with the company's\nauditor. Hexagon has no internal audit function, since the\nfunctions described above satisfy this need. All of Hexagon's\nsubsidiaries report complete financial statements on\na monthly basis.

Within the Board,\nthe Audit Committee is responsible for ensuring that\nsignificant financial risks and the risk of error in financial\nreporting is identified and managed in a manner that\nensures correct financial reporting. Special priority has\nbeen assigned to identifying processes that, to some\nextent, give rise to a higher risk of significant error due to\nthe complexity of the process or of the contexts in which\nmajor values are involved.","3. control activities":"The risks identified with respect to the financial reporting\nprocess are managed via the company's control activities.\nThe control activities are designed to prevent, uncover and\ncorrect errors and non-conformities. Their management\nis conducted by means of manual controls in the form of,\nfor example, reconciliations, automatic controls using IT\nsystems and general controls conducted in the underlying\nIT environment. Detailed analyses of financial results and\nevaluation in relation to budget and forecasts supplement\nthe business-specific controls and provide general\nconfirmation of the quality of the financial reporting.","4. information and communication":"To ensure the completeness and correctness of financial\nreporting, Hexagon has formulated information and\ncommunication guidelines designed to ensure that\nrelevant and significant information is exchanged within\nthe business, within the particular unit and to and from\nmanagement and the Board. Guidelines, handbooks and\njob descriptions pertaining to the financial process are\ncommunicated between management and personnel and\nare accessible electronically and/or in a printed format.\nThe Board receives regular feedback in respect of the\ninternal control process from the Audit Committee. To\nensure that the external communication of information\nis correct and complete, Hexagon complies with a Board\napproved information policy that stipulates what may be\ncommunicated, by whom and in what manner.","5. monitoring activities":"The efficiency of the process for risk assessment and\nthe implementation of control activities are reviewed\ncontinuously. The follow-up pertains to both formal and\ninformal procedures used by the officers responsible\nat each level. The procedures incorporate the review of\nfinancial results in relation to budget and plans, analyses\nand key figures. The Board obtains current and regular\nreports on Hexagon's financial position and performance.\nAt each Board meeting, the company's financial position is\naddressed and, on a monthly basis, management analyses\nthe company's financial reporting at a detailed level.

We also set several ambitious\nsustainability goals in 2021, including becoming carbon\nneutral in our entire value chain by 2050, conducting\nsustainability supplier audits on 100 per cent of our direct\nsuppliers in key risk areas by 2023 and achieving at least 30\nper cent women in leadership positions by 2025.\nBy empowering an autonomous, sustainable future, Hexagon\nwill continue driving growth and shareholder value. Our\nprimary function as the Board of Directors is to be the pillar\nthat ensures management has the support and freedom\nto continue building upon Hexagon's success. For us, that\nmeans trusting Hexagon's leadership and supporting\ntheir ability to make fast-paced decisions while providing\nadvice and help where and when we are needed. We remain\nconfident in this strategy, supported by our new five-year\nfinancial targets launched at our 2021 Capital Markets Day.\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors, I want to thank all the\nemployees at Hexagon for their outstanding work and all\nshareholders for their continued trust in us. It is our pleasure\nand privilege to serve on Hexagon's Board of Directors and\ncontinue to execute Hexagon's long-term strategy and further\nits future success.\nGun Nilsson\nChair of the Board"},"board of directors":{"gun nilsson":"Born in 1955\nMember of the Board since 2008\nChair of the Board since 2017\nChair of the Remuneration Committee and\nMember of the Audit Committee\nEducation: B.Sc.

The majority of these activities are managed within each\nsubsidiary of Hexagon. However, certain legal, strategic, sustainability and financial risks\nare managed at the Group level.","market risk management":{"data":"Market risks concern risks such as economic trends, competition and risks related to\nacquisitions and integration. Market risks are primarily managed within each subsidiary\nof Hexagon.\nRisk","acquisitions and integration":"Risk management\nAn important part of Hexagon's current and future growth\nstrategy is to actively pursue strategic acquisitions of companies\nand businesses. It cannot be guaranteed, however, that Hexagon\nwill be able to find suitable acquisition targets, nor can it be\nguaranteed that the necessary financing for future acquisition\ntargets can be obtained on terms acceptable to Hexagon, or at all.\nA lack of acquisition financing or suitable acquisition targets may\nlead to a decreasing growth rate for Hexagon.\nAcquisitions entail risk. The acquired entities' relations with\ncustomers, suppliers and key personnel may be negatively\naffected by the acquisition. There is also a risk that integration\nprocesses may prove more costly or more time consuming than\nestimated and that anticipated synergies in whole or in part fail\nto materialise. An acquisition of a company that is not conducting\nits business in a sustainable way or in compliance with Hexagon's\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics may have a negative impact\non Hexagon's reputation.","impact of the economy and financial markets":"Hexagon monitors many companies to find acquisitions that\ncan strengthen the Group's product portfolio or improve its\ndistribution network. Potential targets are regularly evaluated\nbased on financial, technology and commercial grounds. Every\nacquisition candidate's potential place in the Group is determined\nbased on synergy simulations and implementation strategies.\nEvery effort to complete a thorough due diligence is made in order\nto evaluate potential risks.\nFrom 2000 to date, Hexagon completed more than 170\nacquisitions. Based on its extensive experience in acquisitions\nand integration and clear strategies and goals, Hexagon is\nstrongly positioned to successfully integrate acquired companies\ninto the Group. In Hexagon's standard due diligence process, a\nnumber of sustainability elements are included, such as detailed\nconsideration about the internal controls of the target company,\nquality business practices, environmental matters, employee\nmatters, ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation),\nLEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) or other\nindustry certifications, and anti-corruption/FCPA (Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act) and export controls. Hexagon also evaluates\nwhether target companies are following a robust code of conduct\nand whether the target companies' corporate responsibility and\nsustainability programmes are effective.\nHexagon engages in worldwide operations that are dependent\non global economic and financial market conditions, as well\nas conditions that are unique to certain countries or regions.\nGeneral economic and financial market conditions affect the\ninclination and the capabilities of Hexagon's existing and potential\ncustomers to invest in design, measurement and visualisation\ntechnologies. Weak macroeconomic conditions globally or in part\nof the world may therefore result in lower market growth that falls\nbelow expectations and lower revenues for Hexagon.\nThe ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to\nthe global economy, including in all of the regions in which Hexagon,\nits suppliers, distributors, business partners and customers do\nbusiness and in which Hexagon's workforce is located. The Covid-19\npandemic and efforts to manage it, including those by governmental\nauthorities, have had, and could continue to have, significant\nimpacts on global markets. New variants, uncertainty about the\nlong-term consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic for important\nHexagon customer industries, and an increase of raw material and\nintermediate goods costs could impact Hexagon's sales potential\nand cost structure. While the duration and severity of those impacts\non Hexagon's business are highly uncertain, they have had, and\ncould continue to have, an adverse effect on the business, financial\ncondition and results of operations in many ways.\nHexagon's business is widely spread geographically, with a broad\ncustomer base within numerous market segments. Potential\nnegative effects of a downturn in the developed world may, for\nexample, be partially off-set by growth in emerging markets and\nvice-versa. While Hexagon have developed and continue to develop plans\nintended to help mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic\non the business, a protracted economic downturn may limit the\neffectiveness of those mitigation efforts.\nRisk","geopolitical risks":"Risk management\nUnderstanding geopolitical risk, how geography and economics\ninfluence politics and the relations between countries, is\nimportant in a world that has become more closely intertwined\ndue to the rise of globalisation.\nCurrent geopolitical risks include the current crisis in Ukraine\nresulting from the invasion of the region by Russian forces and\nthe corresponding global sanctions now facing Russian business,\npolitical and economic uncertainty surrounding the vulnerability\nof the interconnected global economy to pandemics and the\npotential for further escalation of the trade issues between the\nUS and China.\nUnderstanding how these geopolitical risks may affect Hexagon's\norganisation, operating results and strategies is critical to\nmaking accurate projections about Hexagon's future growth and\nprofitability. However, what impact the Ukraine crisis, pandemics\nand/or an escalating trade war between the US and China will\nhave on world trade and the global markets, and the demand for\nHexagon's products, over the coming years is still fairly uncertain\nand will to some extent depend upon resolution of any crises and\nwhether agreements regarding access to the markets can be\nsettled.","competition and price pressure":"In order to eliminate risks that may occur due to geopolitics, such as\nsanctions and/or global perception and reputational risk resulting\nfrom doing business in Russia in response to the Ukraine crisis,\ndisruption to international commerce or the global economy,\nHexagon is following developments closely while evaluating\ndifferent strategies in order to prepare for and handle possible\nscenarios that may affect Hexagon's organisation and the ability to\ndo business in different parts of the world in the near term and over\nthe coming years.\nParts of Hexagon's operation are carried out in sectors which\nare subject to price pressure and rapid technological change.\nHexagon's ability to compete in the market by introducing new\nand successful products with enhanced functionality while\nsimultaneously cutting costs on new and existing products is of\nthe utmost importance in order to avoid erosion of market share.\nOther inherent risks exist with competitors, such as consolidation\nor entry into Hexagon's markets by companies with significant\nresources. R&D efforts are costly and new product development\nalways entails a risk of unsuccessful product launches\nor commercialisation, which could have material adverse\nconsequences on Hexagon. Further, technological innovation and\nchanging trends, such as disruptive technologies, supply chains,\nnew market entrants or novel business models, creates inherent\nrisks that are difficult to foresee.\nHexagon invests annually approximately 10-13 per cent of its net\nsales in R&D. In total almost 5,000 employees are engaged in\nR&D at Hexagon. The objectives for Hexagon's R&D division are\nto transform customer needs into products and services and to\ndetect market and technology opportunities early on. Introducing\nnew products and technologies requires active intellectual\nproperty management to secure Hexagon's technological\nposition."},"operational risk management":{"data":"Operational risks concern risks related to reception of new products and services,\ndependence on suppliers and risks related to human capital. Since the majority of\noperational risks are attributable to Hexagon's customer and supplier relations, ongoing\nrisk analyses of customers and suppliers are conducted to assess business risks.\nOperational risks are primarily managed within each subsidiary of Hexagon.\nRisk","customers":"Risk management\nHexagon's business activities are conducted in a large number\nof markets with multiple customer categories. In 2021, Surveying\nwas the single largest customer category and accounted for\n20 per cent of net sales. For Hexagon, this customer category\nmay involve certain risks as a downturn or weak development in\nthe surveying sector can have a negative impact on Hexagon's\nbusiness. Surveying is followed by customer categories\nElectronics and Manufacturing with 17 per cent, Infrastructure\nand Construction with 15 per cent and 10 per cent and Power\nand Energy with 12. Changing demand of Hexagon's customers is\npossible as technology needs and consumption change over time.\nHexagon may face risks, including reputational risks, of expending\ncapital and resources in generating new business in Russia while\nthe Ukraine crisis is ongoing and/or if customers are misusing the\ncompany's products in ways that negatively impact human rights.\nFurther, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, delays, cancellations, or\nchanges to user and industry conferences and other marketing\nevents relating to Hexagon's solutions, including its own customer\nand partner events, may negatively impact the ability to obtain\nnew and retain existing customers, and effectively market\nHexagon's solutions.","suppliers":"Hexagon has a favourable risk diversification in products and\ngeographical areas, and no single customer or customer category\nis decisive for the Group's performance. The largest customer\nrepresents approximately 1 per cent of the Group's total net\nsales. Credit risk in customer receivables accounts for the\nmajority of Hexagon's counterparty risk. Hexagon believes there\nis no significant concentration of counterparty risk. Further,\nin response to the Ukraine crisis, Hexagon has suspended\nnew business in Russia. If any services are required to support\nand maintain those Russian customers who are not subject to\nsanctions, Hexagon will continue to provide such minimal support\nactivities. Hexagon's compliance programme addresses all principles\ncontained in the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, including\nexport controls. Hexagon is committed to complying with\nappropriate export controls, and the company's compliance\nefforts aim to safeguard peace and security by preventing the\nunlawful trading of items (i.e., goods, software or technology)\nor diversion to destinations where they may be used for illegal\npurposes. Hexagon's hardware products consist of components from\nseveral different suppliers. To be in a position to sell and deliver\nsolutions to customers, Hexagon is dependent upon deliveries\nfrom third parties in accordance with agreed requirements\nrelating to, for example, quantity, quality and delivery times.\nErroneous or default deliveries by suppliers can cause delay\nor default in Hexagon's deliveries, which can result in reduced\nsales. Supply chain, transportation and logistics availability\nare increasingly difficult and costly due primarily to Covid-19\npandemic related factors and shortages. Further, Hexagon uses\nsubcontractors, distributors, resellers and other representatives.\nHexagon may face risks, including reputational risks, if suppliers\nare operating in ways that negatively impact human rights. The\nCovid-19 pandemic temporarily resulted in an inability to meet\nin person or otherwise effectively communicate with current or\npotential vendors, suppliers, and partners, which may negatively\naffect current and future relationships with such vendors,\nsuppliers, and partners and Hexagon's ability to generate demand\nfor solutions.\nIf there were to be unmanaged negative impacts following a\nsupplier's noncompliance with Hexagon's Code of Business\nConduct and Ethics and/or Hexagon's Supplier Code of Conduct,\nit may result in reputational risks for Hexagon.","production and distribution units":"Hexagon has a favourable risk diversification, and no single\nsupplier is decisive for the Group's performance. The largest\nsupplier accounted for approximately 1 per cent of Hexagon's\ntotal net sales in 2021. To minimise the risk of supply shortages\nor of excessive price variations among suppliers, Hexagon works\nactively to coordinate sourcing within the Group and to identify\nalternative suppliers for strategic components. Supplier risk\nsurveys are performed (by Hexagon's external partner) in order\nto identify and mitigate risks associated with the suppliers'\noperations. Hexagon also has a sustainability risk assessment and supplier\naudit process in place, including handling the risk of breaches in\nhuman rights. Hexagon has a compliance programme in place for\nsuppliers to manage social and ethical risks. Hexagon regularly\nconducts supplier audits to ensure suppliers are compliant\nwith the Hexagon's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and\nHexagon's Supplier Code of Conduct.\nHexagon's production and distribution units are exposed to risks\n(fire, explosion, natural hazards, machinery damages, cyber\nthreats, infrastructure failures, power outages, etc.) that could\nlead to property damage and business interruption. This risk is\nfurther accentuated by climate change, which has a direct impact\non the frequency and severity of these events.\nRisk grading surveys are performed (by Hexagon's external\npartner) in order to identify and mitigate risks as well as support\nlocal management in their loss prevention work. Surveys are\nconducted with each subsidiary in accordance with a long-term\nplan. Hexagon has implemented ISO 9001 at the majority of the\nlargest production sites.\nRisk","human capital":"Risk management\nThe resignation of key employees or Hexagon's failure to attract\nskilled and diverse personnel to all different levels within\nthe organisation may have an adverse impact on the Group's\noperations. Further, maintaining Hexagon's company culture is\ncritical to attracting and retaining top talent.\nHexagon's workforce was and continues to be in various parts\nof its organisation, unable or unwilling to work on-site or travel\nas a result of event cancellations, facility closures, shelter-in-\nplace, travel and other restrictions and changes in industry\npractice due to the Covid-19 pandemic, or if they, their co-workers\nor their family members become ill or otherwise require care\narrangements. These workforce disruptions have adversely\naffected and could continue to adversely affect Hexagon's\nability to operate, including to develop, manufacture, generate\nsales of, promote, market and deliver hardware and software\nproducts, solutions and services, and provide customer support.\nAdoption of new laws or regulations, or changes to existing laws\nor regulations, that may be imposed as a result of the Covid-19\npandemic, may cause risks in the company's ability to hire and\nretain skilled professionals.","environment":"Since future success is largely dependent on the capacity to\nretain, recruit and develop skilled staff, being an attractive\nemployer to both potential and existing employees is an\nimportant success factor for Hexagon. Group and business\narea management jointly handle risks associated with human\ncapital. Hexagon works with a structured approach to HR and\nmarket-based remuneration to ensure employee satisfaction.\nHexagon uses employee engagement as the overall measure in\nthe employee survey.\nIn order to attract skilled employees, Hexagon cooperates with\nmultiple universities and colleges around the world, aiming at\ntraining and hiring students with industry-ready skills.\nHexagon provides sensors, software and data to its customers.\n60 per cent of the revenues are from software and services.\nHexagon does not operate any business that require carbon\ncredits. However, stricter regulation of environmental matters\ncan result in increased costs or further investments for the\ncompanies within Hexagon which are subject to such regulation.\nClimate change can result in natural disasters and increase the\nrisk of physical damage on assets and supply shortages. Hexagon\nis impacted by such legislation in a manner similar to other\ncompanies operating in these fields.","business ethics and corruption":"Hexagon believes that it is in material compliance with all\napplicable laws and obligations and obtains relevant approvals\nwhere needed. Hexagon continuously monitors anticipated and\nimplemented changes in legislation in the countries in which\nit operates. Hexagon routinely assesses the risk of climate\nchange on its operations as part of its Insurance Programme.\nHexagon has implemented ISO 14001 at the majority of the\nlargest production sites and has implemented a sustainability\nprogramme to reduce its carbon impact in its own operations and\nin its value chain.\nCorruption negatively impacts communities and overall global\neconomic development and erodes the trust necessary to build\na stable business environment. Additionally, businesses such\nas Hexagon may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by\nemployees, strategic or local partners or other representatives. If\nHexagon or its intermediaries fail to comply with anti-corruption\nlaws, governmental authorities could seek to impose civil and/or\ncriminal fines and penalties which could have an adverse effect\non Hexagon's business. For Hexagon, anti-corruption compliance\nis of utmost importance, as it helps Hexagon advance its financial\ninterests and brand value.","cyber risks and data protection":"Hexagon has a robust Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and\nAnti-Corruption Compliance Programme in place, covering the\nentire Group, including policies, processes and training. The anti-\ncorruption compliance documents include policies in such areas\nas gifts and entertainment (both to and from third parties), hiring\ncandidates with government connections and engaging in and\ntransacting business with third parties.\nHexagon relies on IT systems in its operations. Disruptions or\nfaults in critical systems may have a negative impact on Hexagon's\noperations, including impact on production, Hexagon's tangible\nand intellectual property and, in some cases, the intellectual\nproperty and operations of external parties. The Covid-19\npandemic has presented security challenges as employees and\nthose of Hexagon's partners, customers and service providers\nwork remotely from non-corporate managed networks during the\nongoing Covid-19 pandemic and potentially beyond.\nIncidents may also lead to data privacy infringements such as\nunauthorised access, leakage or loss of data. Data security and\nintegrity are critical issues for the Hexagon Group. Under the\nGDPR, and other analogous legislation in various jurisdictions,\nand ePrivacy regulations, Hexagon has firm legal requirements\nto protect against personal information (PI) data breaches. The\nregulations extend to all vendors that Hexagon uses to collect,\nstore and process PI data on its behalf. In China, there is a similar\nlaw recently adopted to protect various data types, including PI\ndata. It is critical for Hexagon to protect and secure all data as the\ncosts of remediating a serious breach are high and can also be\ndamaging to Hexagon's reputation.\nCyber security risks are increasing in society in general and\nHexagon works continuously to keep the company's IT systems\nprotected. In addition, Hexagon invests in enhanced disaster\nrecovery and data storage capabilities, cyber security expertise,\nand adequate insurance protection. Hexagon also mitigates\nIT-related risks through contracts with external parties.\nHexagon has mandated that all divisions must implement a\nrecognised cybersecurity framework. Hexagon has set the\nminimum standard of implementing the NIST-800171 framework\nas the entry-level approach. Divisions will assess their needs as\nthey relate to customer requirements and may need to implement\nmore stringent frameworks such as ISO27001/NIST-800-53."},"financial risk management":{"data":"Financial risks are managed at the Group level. The Group Treasury Policy, which is\nupdated and approved annually by the Board of Directors, stipulates the rules and\nlimitations for the management of financial risks throughout the Group. Hexagon's\ninternal bank coordinates the management of financial risks and is also responsible for\nthe Group's external borrowing and internal financing. Additional financial risks include,\nbut are not limited to, the risks of varying business results, seasonal variation, and\nchanges to accounting principles (or application thereof).\nRisk","currency":"Risk management\nHexagon's operations are mainly conducted internationally.\nDuring 2021, total operating earnings, excluding non-recurring\nitems, from operations in currencies other than EUR amounted\nto an equivalent of 975.1 MEUR (808.2). Of these currencies, CHF,\nCNY and USD have the biggest impact on Hexagon's earnings and\nnet assets. Currency risk is the risk that currency exchange rate\nfluctuations will have an adverse effect on the income statement,\nbalance sheet or cash flow.\nSales and purchases of goods and services in currencies other\nthan the subsidiary's functional currency give rise to transaction\nexposure. Translation exposure arises when the income statement and\nbalance sheet are translated into EUR. The balance sheet\ntranslation exposure might substantially affect other compre-\nhensive income negatively. Furthermore, the comparability of\nHexagon's earnings between periods is affected by changes in\ncurrency exchange rates. The income statement translation\nexposure is described in the table below for the currencies\nhaving the largest impact on Hexagon's earnings and net assets,\nincluding the effect on Hexagon's operating earnings in 2021.\nNet of income\nMovement1 and cost\nProfit impact\nCHF Weakened -1%\nNegative Positive USD Weakened -4%\nPositive Negative CNY Strengthened 3% Positive EBIT1, MEUR\n1) Compared to EUR and 2020","interest":"Hexagon's reporting currency is EUR, which has a stabilising\neffect on certain key ratios that are of importance to Hexagon's\ncost of capital.\nAs much as possible, currency transaction exposure is\nconcentrated in the countries where the manufacturing entities\nare located. This is achieved by invoicing the sales entities in their\nrespective functional currency by the manufacturing entities.\nAccording to the Group's financial policy, currency transaction\nexposure should not be hedged using external financial\ninstruments. The rationale for this is that the vast majority of\ntransactions entail a short period of time from order to payment.\nMoreover, a transaction hedge only postpones the effect of a\nchange in currency rates.\nThe translation exposure can be mitigated by denominating\nborrowings in the same currency as the corresponding net assets.\nBut in order to have the volatility in net debt at an acceptable\nlevel, currently the majority of the borrowings is denominated\nin EUR.\nThe interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest\nrates will adversely affect the Group's net interest expense\nand/or cash flow. Interest rate exposure arises primarily from\noutstanding loans. The impact on the Group's net interest\nexpense depends, among other things, on the average interest\nrate for borrowings.\nIn accordance with the Group Treasury Policy, the average interest\nrate duration of the external debt is to be between 6 months and\n3 years. During the year, interest rate derivatives were used to\nmanage the interest rate risk.\nRisk","credit":"Risk management\nCredit risk, i.e., the risk that customers may be unable to fulfil\ntheir payment obligations, accounts for the majority of Hexagon's\ncounterparty risk.\nFinancial credit risk is the exposure to default of counterparties\nwith which Hexagon has invested cash or with which it has entered\ninto forward exchange contracts or other financial instruments.","liquidity":"Through a combination of geographical and industry diversification\nof customers, the risk for significant credit losses is reduced.\nTo reduce Hexagon's financial credit risk, surplus cash is only\ninvested with a limited number of approved banks and derivative\ntransactions are only conducted with counterparties where an\nISDA (International Swaps and Derivatives Association) netting\nagreement has been established. As Hexagon is a net borrower,\nexcess liquidity is primarily used to repay external debt and\ntherefore the average surplus cash invested with banks is kept as\nlow as possible.\nLiquidity risk is the risk of not being able to meet payment\nobligations in full as they become due or only being able to do so at\nmaterially disadvantageous terms due to lack of cash resources.","refinancing":"The Group Treasury Policy states that the total liquidity reserve\nshall at all times be at least 10 per cent of forecasted annual net\nsales. At year-end 2021, cash and unutilised credit limits totalled\nRefinancing risk refers to the risk that Hexagon does not have\nsufficient financing available when needed to refinance maturing\ndebt, because existing lenders decline to provide additional credit\nor difficulties arise in procuring new lines of credit at a given point\nin time. Hexagon's ability to satisfy future capital needs is to a\nlarge degree dependent on successful sales of the company's\nproducts and services. There is no guarantee that Hexagon will be\nable to generate necessary capital from sales or from third party\nfinancing arrangements. In this regard, the general development\nof the capital and credit markets is also of major importance.\nHexagon, moreover, requires sufficient financing in order to\nrefinance maturing debt. Securing these requirements demands\na strong financial position of the Group, combined with active\nmeasures to ensure access to credit. There is no guarantee that\nHexagon will be able to raise sufficient funds in order to refinance\nmaturing debt.","insurable risk":"In order to ensure that appropriate financing is in place and to\ndecrease refinancing risk, no more than 20 per cent of the Group's\ngross debt, including committed credit facilities, is allowed to\nmature within the succeeding 12 months unless replacement\nfacilities have been entered into.\nHexagon's main sources of financing consist of:\n- A multicurrency revolving credit facility (RCF) established during\n2021. The RCF amounts to 1,500 MEUR with a tenor of 5+1+1\nyears. - A Swedish Medium-Term Note Programme (MTN) established\nduring 2014. The MTN programme amounts to 20,000 MSEK\nand gives Hexagon the option to issue bonds with tenors of up\nto 6 years.\n- A Swedish Commercial Paper Programme (CP) established\nduring 2012. The CP programme gives Hexagon the option to\nissue commercial paper for a total amount of 15,000 MSEK with\ntenor up to 12 months.\nHexagon's operations, assets and staff are to a certain degree\nexposed to various risks of damages, losses and injuries which\ncould tentatively threaten the Group's business continuity,\nearnings, financial assets and personnel.\nTo ensure a well-balanced insurance coverage and financial\neconomies of scale, Hexagon's insurance programme includes,\namong other things, group-wide property and liability insurance,\ntravel insurance, errors and omissions insurance and transport\ninsurance, combined with local insurance coverage wherever\nneeded. The insurance programme is periodically amended so\nthat owned risk and insured risk are optimally balanced."},"legal risk management":{"data":"Legal risks are primarily managed within each subsidiary of Hexagon. The Group legal\nfunction supports the subsidiaries and manages certain legal risks at the Group level.\nRisk","legislation and regulation":"Risk management\nHexagon's main markets are subject to extensive regulation.\nHexagon's operations may be affected by regulatory changes,\nchanges to customs duties and other trading obstacles, and\npricing and currency controls, as well as other government\nlegislation and restrictions in the countries where Hexagon is\nactive. For example, more stringent regulations have been passed\nor are being developed in several jurisdictions, causing increased\nresponsibilities for companies regarding the privacy and\nprocessing of personal data. These changing requirements and\nmore stringent rules impose a risk of non-compliance with these\ndata protection regulations, which could result in substantial\nlegal fees and damage to Hexagon's reputation. Additional areas\nof regulatory uncertainty include laws and regulations related\nto environmental sustainability (including climate change). For\nexample, new laws and regulations in response to climate change\ncould result in increased energy efficiency for Hexagon's products\nand increased compliance and energy costs.","intellectual property rights":"Hexagon closely monitors legislation, regulations and applicable\nordinances in each market and seeks to adapt the business to\nidentified future changes in each market. To manage country-\nspecific risks, Hexagon observes local legislation and monitors\npolitical developments in the countries where the Group conducts\noperations. To this effect, Hexagon has adopted a worldwide\ncompliance programme across the Group to ensure that its\nsubsidiaries at all times comply with all applicable legislation,\nrules and ordinances. Further, with respect to the Ukraine crisis,\nHexagon will continue complying with all applicable export control\nrestrictions and sanctions laws relevant to our operations and\nwith the rules of ethics and international standards.\nIntellectual property infringement and plagiarism by third parties\nare risks to which Hexagon is exposed. There is no guarantee that\nHexagon will be able to protect obtained patents, trademarks and\nother intellectual property rights or that submitted applications\nfor registration will be granted. Furthermore, there is a risk\nthat new technologies and products are developed which\ncircumvent or replace Hexagon's intellectual property rights.\nInfringement disputes can, like disputes in general, be costly and\ntime consuming and may therefore adversely affect Hexagon's\nbusiness. Additionally, third parties may assert that Hexagon's\nproducts infringe their intellectual property rights.\nTax Hexagon seeks to protect its technology innovations to safeguard\nthe returns on the resources that Hexagon assigns to R&D.\nThe Group strives to protect its technical innovations through\npatents and protects its intellectual property rights through legal\nproceedings when warranted. Such intellectual property rights\ncan generally only be enforced in jurisdictions that have granted\nsuch protections or recognise these rights.\nHexagon operates through subsidiaries in a number of jurisdictions\nand all cross-border transactions are normally a tax risk because\nthere are no global transfer pricing rules. Local tax authorities\nfollow their own local transfer pricing rules and authorities interpret\ntransfer pricing guidelines differently. Hexagon frequently interacts\nwith local taxing authorities and frequently has several ongoing tax\naudits in progress.\nHexagon's interpretation of prevailing tax law, tax treaties,\nOECD guidelines and agreements entered into with foreign\ntax authorities may be challenged by tax authorities in some\ncountries. Rules and guidelines may also be subject to future\nchanges which can have an adverse effect on the Group's tax\nposition. Furthermore, a change in the business or part of the\nbusiness can have an impact on agreements entered into with\ntax authorities in some tax jurisdictions.\nThe tax rate may increase if large acquisitions are made in high\ntax jurisdictions or if the corporate tax rates change in countries\nwhere Hexagon carries out substantial business.\nTransactions between Group companies are carried out in\naccordance with Hexagon's interpretation of prevailing tax laws,\ntax treaties, OECD's guidelines and agreements entered into\nwith foreign tax authorities. Risks are also presented by new\naccounting rules or interpretations by the applicable governing\nbodies."}},"financial reports":"","consolidated income statement":"MEUR Note Gross earnings\nCapital

All amounts, unless\nindicated otherwise, are rounded off to the nearest million with\none decimal.\nAssets and liabilities are reported at historical cost except for\ncertain financial instruments which are reported at fair value.\nReceivables and liabilities or income and expenses are only off-\nset if required or explicitly permitted by an accounting standard.\nPreparing the financial statements in compliance with IFRS\nrequires that Management make judgements and estimates as\nwell as make assumptions that affect the application of account-\ning principles and the amounts recognised as assets, liabilities,\nincome and expenses. The actual outcome may diverge from\nthese estimates and assumptions. Estimates and assumptions\nare reviewed continuously. Changes of estimates are recognised\nin the period when the change is made if the change only affects\ncurrent period or in that period when the change is made and\ncoming periods if the change affects both current period and\ncoming periods.\nJudgements made by Management for the application of IFRS\nthat have a substantial impact on the financial reports and esti-\nmates made that may lead to significant adjustments in coming\nyears' financial reports are described in more detail in Note 2.","classification":"Fixed assets and long-term liabilities essentially consist of\namounts expected to be realised or settled after twelve months\nfrom the balance sheet date. Current assets and short-term liabil-\nities essentially consist only of amounts expected to be realised\nor settled within twelve months from the balance sheet date. The\nGroup's operating cycle is assessed to be less than one year.","consolidated financial statements":"The consolidated financial statements consolidate the Parent\nCompany and the other companies in which the Parent Company\nhas a controlling influence, that is, is exposed or has right to\nvariable returns from its involvement and has the ability to affect\nthose returns through its involvement.\nCompanies or businesses acquired (acquisitions) are accounted for\nunder the purchase method. The method involves a business combi-\nnation to be regarded as a transaction in which the Group indirectly\nacquires the assets of the business and assumes its liabilities. The\nGroup's acquisition cost is determined through a purchase price allo-\ncation in connection with the acquisition. The acquisition cost is the\nsum of the fair value at the acquisition date of what is paid in cash,\nassumed liabilities or issue of own shares.\nContingent considerations are often conditional by future goals on\nsales or performance. At acquisition date, an estimation of the fulfil-\nment of the goals is made. The contingent consideration is measured\nat fair value and included in the acquisition cost and recognised as a\nfinancial liability in accordance with IFRS. Long-term contingent con-\nsiderations are discounted to present value. The measurement to\nfair value is initially based on the expected outcome of the acquired\ncompany's sales or performance. Contingent considerations are\nsubsequently measured at fair value and essential effects of remea-\nsurements are recognised in the income statement in accordance\nwith IFRS. If a revenue is recognised as a consequence of a change\nin estimation, the surplus values from the acquisition will be tested\nfor impairment. If the impairment test results in an impairment, the\nexpense will meet the revenue from the remeasurement of the con-\ntingent consideration. Transaction costs are expensed in the income\nstatement when incurred.\nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are rec-\nognised initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Excep-\ntions are made for acquired tax assets and liabilities, employee\nbenefits, stock-based compensation and assets held for sale,\nvalued in accordance with the principles described for each item\nin in each standard.\nGoodwill recorded represents the difference between the acqui-\nsition cost of group companies' shares, the value of non-con-\ntrolling interest in the acquired business and the fair value of\npreviously owned shares and on the other hand, the purchase\nprice allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nFor goodwill disclosures, see Note 14 Intangible fixed assets.\nNon-controlling interests are recognised at the acquisition date,\neither at its fair value or at its proportionate share of the carrying\nvalue of the acquires identifiable assets and liabilities. Acquisition\nof non-controlling interest is reported as transactions between\nshareholders, i.e. within equity.\nGroup companies' financial statements are included in the con-\nsolidated accounts as of the date when control occurs (acqui-\nsition date) until the control ceases. When control of the Group\ncompany ceases, but the Group retains shares in the company,\nremaining shares are initially reported at fair value. The gain or\nloss from remeasurement is recorded in the income statement.","translation of financial reports to eur":"Assets and liabilities in operations with a functional currency\nother than EUR are translated at the closing day exchange rate\nand income statements are translated at average exchange\nrates for the period. The resulting translation differences are\nrecognised directly in other comprehensive income. The amount\nis recognised separately as a translation reserve in equity. In case\nof divestment of an operation with a functional currency other\nthan EUR the accumulated translation differences related to the\ndivested operation are reclassified from equity to income state-\nment at the time of recognition of capital gain or loss from the\ndivestment. Monetary long-term items towards businesses with a functional\ncurrency other than EUR, for which settlement is not planned or\nwill probably not occur within the foreseeable future, are part\nof the company's net investment. Translation differences on\nsuch monetary items, which comprise part of the company's net\ninvestment are recognised in other comprehensive income and\naccumulated in the translation reserve in equity.","transactions, assets and liabilities other currencies than eur":"Transactions in non-EUR currencies are recognised in the func-\ntional currency at the exchange rate on the transaction day.\nMonetary assets and liabilities are translated to the functional\ncurrency on the closing day at the exchange rate then in effect.\nExchange rate differences that arise through these translations\nare recognised in the income statement.","eliminated transactions":"Intra-Group receivables and liabilities, revenue or expenses and\ngains or losses that arise from transactions between group com-\npanies are eliminated in their entirety in the preparation of the\nconsolidated accounts. Losses are eliminated in the same way as\ngains, but only to the extent that there is no impairment loss.","earnings per share":"The calculation of earnings per share is based on net earnings\nattributable to the Parent Company shareholders and on the\nweighted number of shares outstanding during the year. The cal-\nculation of earnings per share after dilution takes into account the\nquarterly calculated dilutive effect from any potential common\nshares.","government grants":"Government grants have been recognised in accordance with IAS\n20. Receivables and revenue are recognised when there is reason-\nble assurance that the terms and conditions will be met, and it is\nreasonably certain that the grant will be received.","share programme":"Hexagon's share programme is accounted for according to IFRS 2\nand is classified as an equity-settled share-based payment trans-\naction, which means the programme is reported within equity.\nSocial fees are reported as a liability in the balance sheet.","accounting policies in the parent company":"The Parent Company applies the same accounting principles as\nthe Group with the following deviations:\n- In the Parent Company, the exemption in RFR 2 for IFRS 9 Finan-\ncial Instruments is applied. This means, among other things, that\nfinancial instruments are valued based on acquisition value and\nthe principles of impairment testing of loss risk provisions in\nIFRS 9 are applied to the Parent Company's short-term receiv-\nables and financial fixed assets.\n- In the Parent Company, the exemption in RFR 2 for IFRS 16 Leasing\nAgreements is applied and the costs for all leasing agreements\nare reported on a straight-line basis over the leasing period.\n- In the Parent Company participations in Group Companies are\nreported at acquisition value less any impairment.\n- Acquisition value of shares in subsidiaries includes transaction\ncosts and contingent consideration.\n- Non-monetary assets acquired in a currency other than EUR are\nreported at historical exchange rates. Other assets and liabilities\nin currencies other than EUR are reported at the exchange rate on\nthe balance sheet date.\n- The Parent Company applies the alternative rule for group contri-\nbutions and reports both submitted and received group contribu-\ntions and appropriations in the income statement.","dividends":"The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors reduces earnings\navailable for distribution and is recognised as a liability when the\nAnnual General Meeting has approved the dividend.","approval of accounts":"The Parent Company's and the consolidated financial statements\nwill be presented to the Annual General Meeting for adoption on\n29 April 2022."},"critical accounting estimates and assumptions":{"data":"The critical accounting estimates and assumptions that are\naddressed in this section are those that Company Management\nand the Board of Directors regard as the most important for\nunderstanding Hexagon's financial reporting. The information\nis limited to areas that are significant considering the degree\nof impact and underlying uncertainty. Hexagon's accounting\nestimates and assumptions are based on historical experience\nand assumptions that company management and the Board of\nDirectors regard as reasonable under the current circumstances.\nThe conclusions based on these accounting estimates constitute\nthe foundation for the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities,\nin the event that they cannot be established through information\nfrom other sources. The actual outcome may differ from these\naccounting estimates and assumptions.","customer contracts":"Parts of Hexagon's sales derive from major and complex customer\ncontracts. The critical estimates of customer contracts include\nestablishing the amounts that are to be recognised as income and\nwhen the income should be recognised. For example, company\nmanagement makes estimates of completed performance in\nrelation to the contractual terms and conditions, the estimated\ntotal contractual costs and the proportion of the contract that\nhas been completed at a certain point in time. The degree of com-\npletion is established by setting incurred cost in relation to total\ncosts required to complete the contract. The estimations are also\nbase for any loss provision, if any.\nHexagon also enters into revenue agreements that contain mul-\ntiple elements, such as hardware, software and/or services. For\nthese agreements, Hexagon need to assess if revenue should\nbe allocated to each element as different accounting principles\napply for these elements.","intangible assets":"Intangible assets within Hexagon concern essentially pertain to\ngoodwill, trademarks and other assets as a result of acquisition,\nsuch as customer relationships and technology. Goodwill and\nother acquired intangible assets with an indefinite life are not\nsubject to annual amortisation, while other intangible assets are\namortised. Insofar as the underlying operations develop nega-\ntively, an impairment requirement may arise. Impairment test is\nimplemented if necessary, but at least once a year. Such intan-\ngible assets are subject to annual impairment testing, which is\nessentially based on the value in use, making assumptions about\nthe sales trend, the Group's profit margins, on-going investments,\nchanges in working capital and discount interest rate. Company\nmanagement considers the assumptions applied to be compat-\nible with the data received from external sources of information\nor from previous experience. Hexagon's goodwill on 31 December\namounted to 8,205.6MEUR (5,705.6). Other intangible assets not\nsubject to amortisation amount to 1,035.5 MEUR (991.8) as of this\ndate. Performed impairment tests demonstrate that reported\nvalues are defendable.","tax assets and liabilities":"The Board of Directors and Company Management continuously\nassess the carrying amount of both current and deferred tax\nassets and liabilities. For deferred tax assets, Hexagon has to\nassess the probability of whether it will be possible to utilise\nthe deductible temporary differences that give rise to deferred\ntax assets to offset future taxable profits. In addition, in certain\nsituations, the value of the deferred tax assets and liabilities\nmay be uncertain due to ongoing tax processes, for example.\nAccordingly, the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may\ndeviate from these estimates due to a change in future earning\ncapacity, changed tax regulations or the outcome of examinations\nby authorities or tax courts of issued or not yet issued tax returns.\nWhen assessing the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities,\nHexagon has to form an opinion of the tax rate that will apply at\nthe time of the reversal of the temporary differences. Hexagon\nrecognised deferred tax liabilities, net in an amount of 372.1 MEUR\n(358.1) net, at the end of 2021. At the same date, the Group had\ntax-loss carry-forwards with a value of 49.3 MEUR (45.5) that were\nnot recognised as assets. These assets could not be capitalised\nbased on assessments of the opportunity to utilise the tax defi-\ncits. In comparison with the final outcome, the estimates made\nconcerning both deferred tax assets and liabilities could have\neither a positive or a negative impact on earnings.","pension obligations":"Within Hexagon, there are defined-benefit pension schemes\nbased on significant assumptions concerning future benefits\npertaining to either the current or prior workforce. Pension obli-\ngations amounted to 69.3 MEUR (124.3) at the end of 2021. When\ncalculating the pension liability, a number of actuarial assump-\ntions are of major significance to the outcome of the calculation.\nThe most critical pertain to the discount interest rate on the\nobligation, the rate of pay increases, employee turnover and esti-\nmated length of life. A reduced discount interest rate increases\nthe recognised pension liability. The actual outcome could deviate\nfrom the recognised amount if the applied assumptions prove to\nbe wrong.","business combination":"Hexagon acquire companies on a continuous basis. In connection\nwith the acquisitions, acquired assets and assumed liabilities are\nvalued to fair value in a purchase price allocation analysis.

We are\nindependent of the parent company and the group in accordance\nwith professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have\notherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with\nthese requirements. This includes that, based on the best of our\nknowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the\nAudit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the\naudited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its\ncontrolled companies within the EU.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient\nand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.","other matter":"The audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts for\nyear 2021 was performed by another auditor who submitted an\nauditorÂ´s report dated 1 April 2021, with unmodified opinions in the\nReport on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.","our audit approach":"Audit scope\nWe designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing\nthe risks of material misstatement in the consolidated financial\nstatements. In particular, we considered where management\nmade subjective judgements; for example, in respect of signifi-\ncant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and\nconsidering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all\nof our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override\nof internal controls, including among other matters consideration\nof whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of\nmaterial misstatement due to fraud.\nWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient\nwork to enable us to provide an opinion on the consolidated finan-\ncial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of\nthe Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the indus-\ntry in which the group operates.\nThe Hexagon Group comprises a large number of subsidiaries.\nNone of these subsidiaries have, individually, been deemed to be\nsignificant for the audit of the Group. For the Group audit, we have\nselected the Parent company and a large number of entities allo-\ncated across the Group's five business areas for Group reporting.\nThe majority of the subsidiaries in the Group are also subject to\nstatutory audits according to local requirements.\nFor other reporting units, analytical audit procedures are per-\nformed as a part of the audit of the consolidation. The Group\naudit team has performed site visits in a selected number of legal\nentities as well as performed work on the finance and accounting\nconsolidation processes, treasury operations among others.\nMateriality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of\nmateriality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance\nwhether the financial statements are free from material misstate-\nment. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are\nconsidered material if individually or in aggregate, they could rea-\nsonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users\ntaken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain\nquantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group\nmateriality for the consolidated financial statements as a whole\nas set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative con-\nsiderations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the\nnature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate\nthe effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on\nthe financial statements as a whole.","key audit matter":"Key audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our pro-\nfessional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the\nannual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period.\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and\nin forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consoli-\ndated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opin-\nion on these matters.","revenue recognition":"Key audit matter\nHexagon customer offerings contains solutions in which hardware\nand software are integrated as well as services and licenses. The\ncritical management estimates of customer contracts include\nestablishing the amounts that are to be recognised as income and\nwhen the income should be recognised.\nFor integrated customer contracts management need to assess\nif revenue should be allocated to each revenue type as different\naccounting principles apply for these revenue types. Manage-\nment makes estimates of completed performance in relation to\nthe contractual terms and conditions as as these performance\nobligations are or can be fulfilled at different points in time.\nPart of Hexagons business comes from major long term, com-\nplex and fixed-price customer contracts. Management makes\nestimates of completed performance in relation to the contrac-\ntual terms as a base for recognizing revenue on every reporting\ndate, these estimations are also the base for any potential loss\nprovision. Due to the degree of management judgment in arrangements con-\ntaining multiple performance obligations, these types of arrange-\nments have been a key audit matter in our audit.\nAccounting principles for revenue recognition are included in Note\n5 and key estimates and assumptions used for customer arrange-\nments are included in Note 2.\nHow our audit address the key audit matter\nOur audit included, amongst others a combination of testing of\ninternal controls over financial reporting including procedures\nto test key application configurations, analytical procedures\nincluding analysing complete transactional data sets with soft-\nware tools to identify large transactions, anomalies, unexpected\ntrends or variation. We have, in order to validate revenue for exis-\ntence and accuracy performed detailed tests of new major con-\ntracts in the Hexagon subsidiaries. We have also assessed that\ndisclosures are appropriate.","business combinations":"Key audit matter\nAcquisition of new businesses and the consolidation of new busi-\nnesses (business combinations) include purchase price alloca-\ntions of the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities including\nidentification of goodwill and other intangible assets. The valu-\nation is partly based on management assumptions of the future\nearnings of the acquired business and valuation of intangible\nassets at fair value.\nThe acquisitions contracts includes contingent earn-out pay-\nments which are included in the acquisition cost as a contingent\nconsideration and remeasured at every reporting date and thus\nsubject to management estimates and assumptions.\nBusiness combinations have been a key audit matter in our audit\ndue to the degree of management judgment in identifying and\naccounting of various acquired intangible assets.\nAccounting principles for business combinations are included in\nNote 1 and key estimates and assumptions used for fair values of\nacquires assets and assumed liabilities as well as identification\nof intangible assets and contingent consideration are included in\nNote 2. How our audit address the key audit matter\nOur audit procedures included, amongst others assessment\nof significant purchase agreements, test of the purchase price\nallocations including calculation and accounting for contingent\nconsiderations. We have involved our valuation specialists to\nchallenge the valuation and calculation methods used by manage-\nment. We have also assessed that disclosures are appropriate.","goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives":"Key audit matter\nThe carrying value of goodwill, and other intangible assets with\nindefinite useful lives represent some 65 percent of reported total\nassets. IFRS require annual impairment tests or when there is an\nindication that values could be impaired.given that the carrying\nvalue of these assets are not amortised.\nMarket data, Hexagon's business plans and forecasts on future\ndevelopment forms the expectations on sales, earnings and cash\nflows that are central in the model to calculate a recoverable value\nto be compared to the booked carrying value.\nWe have focused on the valuation of goodwill and intangible\nassets with indefinite useful lives as these items involve a large\ndegree of judgement on behalf of management in assessing\nfuture cash flows.\nThe key assumptions used and management's sensitivity analysis\nfor how changes in key assumptions would affect the value in use\nare presented in Note 8. As stated in Note 2 the impairment test\nrequire management estimates and assumptions such as pro-\njected cash flows, future market conditions and discount rates.\nHow our audit address the key audit matter\nOur audit procedures included amongst others a review of man-\nagement impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with\nindefinite lives. We have examined whether Hexagon's impairment\ntest is based on the divisions' (cash generating units) financial\nforecasts approved by management. We also evaluated the sen-\nsitivity analysis for changes in significant parameters, which, indi-\nvidually or on a collective basis, could imply the existence of an\nimpairment requirement. Valuation experts have been involved to\nchallenge the assumptions and estimates made by management.\nWe have also assessed that disclosures are appropriate.","other information than the annual accounts and consolidated accounts":"This document also contains other information than the annual\naccounts and consolidated accounts and is found on pages 1-13,\n21-33, 79-85.
